# GlassTuner
Google Glass Tuner

Listens and shows what note you're playing.
Can also tell you how sharp/flat you are (using YIN (not FFT) to determine frequency), but initial testing showed inaccurate sharp/flat readings.

Significant audio processing inspiration from: https://github.com/lucns/Android-Audio-Sample/ and https://github.com/chRyNaN/Android-Guitar-Tuner

TODO:
* Change to Immersion
* Find better/refine pitch detection
* Have needle/some UI to show how sharp/flat
* Real-world testing
